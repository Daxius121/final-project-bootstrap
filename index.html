            Will the real Swim Shady please swim up. He's a new addition to my
            tank, and I remodeled just for him! While I was remodeling I decided
            to add more plants and hardscape to the tank to give it a more
            interesting and natural vibe. Swim Shady seems to enjoy his new
            home, and gets along great with his tank mates (as long as they
            don't get in his personal space too much!). Check out the "About"
            tab to follow along the process of remodeling and introducing Swim
            Shady to his new home.

            My favorite place to buy supplies is from a locally owned business
            that has been around for ages called "Whities Pets". Everytime I go
            in there I am absolutely astounded at how well mainained their fish
            tanks are, they even have the names of those who take care of their
            show floor tanks! I would encourage you to shop around at your local
            animal stores as the quality is usually above average and most
            definitely better than local chain stores. Below you will find a map
            to my personal favorite local store and you can click on the image
            to the right to view their website and learn more!
